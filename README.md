# NLP and Shiny Dashboard in R 

This project is Harry Potter themed and answers the question: Are you a Witch/Wizzard or are you not?
If people knew the Harry Potter series they would be predicted to ba a Witch/Wizzard, if not they were predicted to be a Muggle. 

It was a fun way for our team to analyze speech and the text it created. 

First we conducted surveys by speech and processed it through R. We then conducted text analytics which we presented through a Shiny app.
